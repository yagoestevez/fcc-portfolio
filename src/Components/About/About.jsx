              I am a web developer and UX designer based in the beautiful west coast of Spain,
              Galicia.

              I really enjoy solving problems as well as making things pretty and easy to use. I
              can't stop learning new things; the more, the better. I also love photography, a hobby
              I'm taking along since the good old film cameras. Oh, and rice with milk; I have a
              passion for rice with milk!

              For the front-end I usually work with Javascript, either standalone or including
              popular frameworks like ReactJS and VueJS. I also make the web pretty by using Sass,
              CSS and, whenever needed, any of their friends: Bootstrap, Bulma, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the back-end I also work with Javascript (NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, etc). But, of
              course, whenever the project requires PHP, I do PHP as well (Wordpress, Laravel, etc).
            </p>

            <h4 className="subtitle">Also a designer.</h4>
            <p>
              I feel comfortable working with many Adobe products. Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign,
              Lightroom or Xd are some kind of industry standards and I love working with them. I'm
              not limited to them, though: Gimp, Inkscape or Figma are also very valid applications
              that I've been working with.
            </p>
            <p>
              User interfaces, brochures, books, branding... You name it! As I mentioned, creating
              pretty things is particularly important for me.
